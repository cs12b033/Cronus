		## BLOCKER


		## MAJOR
* Get Registration done
	* Send Data to DB [DONE]
		* Check if password == password2
		* make sure password is stores as hash
* Maintain session

		## MINOR
* Fix url misconfigured for management
* Include two-factor authentication for admins (maybe from Google Authenticator app)
* create indexes for iNum in all database tables, to make search faster

		## TRIVIAL
* Write Selenium scripts to test
* Do not send Development server files to Production server (create seperate gitignore file for master branch or write a dev to prod script)
* Remove unused/obselete code and document as much as possible
